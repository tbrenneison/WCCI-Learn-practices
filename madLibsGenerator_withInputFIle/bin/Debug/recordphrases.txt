He sang in the gazebo.
He chirped on the porch.
Programmers collided before the prince.
Programmers collided in the gazebo.
The trampoline collided under the moon.
Programmers sang on the porch.
Programmers watched in the gazebo.
Musicians sang after the storm.
Musicians barbequed after the storm.
Musicians spoke before the prince.
Musicians barbequed over the lake.
Musicians cartwheeled over the lake.
